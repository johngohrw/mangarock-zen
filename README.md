Chrome extension for hiding intrusive elements on MangaRock's desktop manga reader.

Does not demonetize the site. Still loads the ads, only hiding them from view. 

## Chrome Webstore Description

This extension hides ad banner elements in MangaRock's web reader, including ads at the bottom of the page(that takes up precious screen space), interruptive full-page advertisements, and mini video ads appearing at the corner of the screen. 

Normal adblockers only stop the ads from showing, but the intrusive banners and pages still remain. This extension removes the banners and pages completely as well.

This does not demonetize the site. The ads will still load in the background (just hidden from view).
